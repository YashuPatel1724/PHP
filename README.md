## Student Registration Form in PHP
This project implements a simple student registration system with PHP and MySQL. Users fill out a form to input student details like name, age, contact, and course. These details are stored in a MySQL database.

## Key Features

## Database Connection:
- Managed by the Config class (config.php), which connects to the student database using MySQLi.

## Form Submission:
- The form collects user inputs and submits them via POST to the PHP script.
- On submission, the insertData method in the Config class adds the data to the students table.

## Code Highlights:
- The Config class handles database connectivity and query execution.
- HTML form ensures user-friendly input and uses CSS for styling.
- This project is a beginner-friendly example of PHP and MySQL integration for managing basic CRUD operations.

# Description

This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in PHP using Bootstrap for styling. It features a fully functional web application where users can add, view, update, and delete records from a database. The backend is powered by PHP, while MySQL is used as the database management system. The interface is styled with Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness and a user-friendly design.

The project is structured into separate files for clarity and maintainability. The config.php file handles database connectivity, while index.php serves as the main page to display records in a styled table. Other pages like add.php, update.php, and delete.php manage specific operations. The database setup is simplified with an included SQL file (database.sql), which can be easily imported to initialize the required table.

Users can clone this repository to set up the project locally or deploy it on a web server. After configuring the database credentials in config.php, the application will be ready to use. This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn PHP and Bootstrap or as a quick starter template for CRUD applications.
